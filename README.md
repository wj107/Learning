# Learning

Some notebooks documenting my thoughts, discoveries, and experiments as I'm learning more about R.

Some are notebooks, some are markdown files.  Depends if I'm on the chromebook (no Rstudio) or not.  Some scripts, too.  

- L1: Examining map data in R, creating a basic map
- L2: Adding another aesthetic layer to a map
- L3: Creating a very basic shiny app

### Coming soon...

- L4? Another shiny app with a few more moving pieces.  Two or three inputs?  Graph and text output?
- L5? Get back to maps: layer a map with 'real-life' data: population, election data, something like that...
- L6? Combine L4 & L5: shiny apps representing 'real-life' data.
- L7? gganimate...  I'm coming for it!  :-)
