## Maps, part 4

Per usual, last time I had grand goals, but only made it about two or three steps in.  Whatever.  I was grinding, figuring out some stuff... and made a decently cool map at the end, form KML data found online!  

```{r chicago_base_map, echo=FALSE}


5*6

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}

hist(rnorm(5000))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
